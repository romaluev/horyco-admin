Get new changes of features/modules in documentations

I want to get new changes in all modules. You should compare the saved version of that files in git and unstaged changes in that files. 
Then give me detailed change list with all info included. What was removed, what was changed, what was added, we might add completely new modules or delete others. We might completely change the logic of certain module or just update ui workflow or api endpoints. The point is that you should not miss a single change.

The style of documentation or sections might be changed and they're not important

They most important part is feature changes, the info about logics, api, ui workflows.

We will then rely on new documentation so you don't have to repeat what was written there for 100%. So keep the review short and summarize everything.
